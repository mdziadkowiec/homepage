A few months ago I noticed that I reach a certain ceiling. I reach a point where I wasn't able to learn anything new by myself.  Therefore, I came up with an idea to start a new project, where I will ask some authorities that I know to become my mentors so I will be able to ask them a few questions and compare their answers with mine own. I thought that it will be very interesting and challenging for me because I had never done anything like that.

One of my authorities that I know is Ash Furrow. He publicly documented his first ten years of his career as a software developer and did a lot for software developers ie. by creating peerlab.community to help them develop their skills. He agreed to help me with this project but only if my efforts will be publicly documented. 

If you are reading this, please know that this is mostly my own struggle. I am trying my best to explain myself, my current situation, and the solutions that I am following. Hopefully, if you have a similar case, the ideas and solutions that help me grow as Software Developer, Team Leader, and as a person hopefully will help you as well.

I am wishing you all the best!
